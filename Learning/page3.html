    <p>A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic.
        Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.
        This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and thus help the
        reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.</p>

    <p>Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of information. A paragraph could contain a series of brief examples
        or a single long illustration of a general point. It might describe a place, character, or process; narrate a
        series of events; compare or contrast two or more things; classify items into categories; or describe causes and
        effects. Regardless of the kind of information they contain, all paragraphs share certain characteristics. One
        of the most important of these is a topic sentence.</p>
